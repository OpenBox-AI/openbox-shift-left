# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and other agents) working in the **openbox-shift-left**
repo. User-facing documentation lives in `README.md` and `docs/`; this file is only
the working context an agent needs.

## What this repo is

The developer-runtime half of OpenBox governance: one static Go binary that governs
the agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Codex) developers use, feeding the same
pipeline the agent runtime already uses. `README.md` for the product,
`docs/architecture.md` for the shape.

## Core principle: reuse, don't rebuild

Shift-left onboards the developer runtime onto OpenBox's **existing** pipeline rather
than a parallel one:

- register the tool install as an OpenBox agent (`kind=developer`), session as a
  child record — `POST agent/create` → runtime key + DID;
- emit events through the **same** `/api/v1/governance/evaluate` with the **same**
  auth (`Bearer obx_` + AIP signing);
- store in the **same** tables (`sessions` → `governance_events` → `spans`, plus
  Merkle leaves) and read through the **same** services.

**Rule:** prefer reusing an existing table/endpoint/service over adding one. A new
table, endpoint or service requires an ADR in `docs/adr/`.

## Architecture in one line

Provider-agnostic engine + one thin adapter per tool behind a normalized event
contract. Adding a provider is an adapter, not an engine change.

The SPI (`provider/`) is `Installer` (install time) + `HookEngine` (runtime +
capabilities). The engine is `adapters/common/hookflow`: spool, duration stash,
advisory sink, findings loop, staleness gate, the enforce cascade and its gate
sequence, Tier-2 escalation, approval hold, rewake. An adapter is four things — its
native hook shape, its mapper, an `OutputContract`, its installer.

**The engine used to be copy-pasted per adapter** (~85% of non-test adapter code was
a rename-level fork, on the enforcement path) and the copies drifted. Do not
reintroduce that: if something is provider-agnostic it goes in `hookflow` or
`devconfig`.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `provider/` | the SPI |
| `adapters/common/hookflow/` | the engine every adapter runs on |
| `adapters/common/devconfig/`, `adapters/common/git/` | shared config/posture; trailer, notes, attestation |
| `adapters/claude-code/`, `adapters/codex/` | one thin adapter each |
| `client/` | core client: payload, hook spans, AIP signing, verdicts |
| `decision/` | in-process enforcement: bundle, evaluator, secret detection, redaction |
| `cli/` | the `openbox` CLI, incl. `cli/internal/approver` (ADR-0012) |
| `actions/openbox-git-action/` | commit→deploy lineage for CI |
| `contracts/dev-event/` | event schema, wire mapping, conformance |
| `testbed/` | the mock-free end-to-end suite (`docs/testbed/e2e.md`) |
| `docs/` | user documentation — keep it true, and keep it short |

`.claude/` and `.fab7/` are local tooling and git-ignored — do not commit them.

## Working conventions

- **Privacy and security are first-class.** Content capture is **ON by default**
  (2026-07-15, reversing the original metadata-only posture): prompt text egresses
  unless an org opts out (`content_capture:false` / `OPENBOX_CONTENT_CAPTURE=0`).
  Guardrail redaction at source is **not wired yet**, so prompt text egresses
  unredacted. Tool commands and file bodies never egress on observe events; an
  approval escalation is the one exception and is content-gated. Tier-1 secret
  detection redacts Write/Edit bodies locally, in enforce mode. Keep
  `docs/data-and-privacy.md` true.
- **Decisions only a human can make** (scope, privacy posture, priority) are `OD*`
  decisions: surface them, never infer them.
- **Cite sources in docs** — the repo symbol/path or upstream doc URL behind each
  claim. A governance product that overstates itself is the failure it exists to
  prevent, so prefer an honest limit over a confident sentence.
- **Verify against the real thing.** `testbed/run-all.sh` drives real headless
  sessions against a real local stack and asserts what arrived; unit tests are not
  evidence that a hook works.
- Sibling repos: **openbox-backend** (NestJS control plane), **openbox-core** (Go data
  plane), **openbox-temporal-sdk-python** (agent-runtime SDK).

## Build and test

```bash
go build ./cli/...                 # the binary
cd <module> && go test ./...        # per module (go.work lists them all, ADR-0011)
./testbed/run-all.sh               # end to end, needs a local OpenBox stack
```

## Current state

Shipped and verified end to end: observe telemetry, enforce (Tier 1–3), the E9
approval loop with hold + rewake, the autonomous approver (ADR-0012), lineage
(trailer → signed attestation → deploy → queryable links) including its read side,
the managed-config posture layer, and `openbox init` as the single onboarding front
door with `--role approver` and `--base-url`.

Near-real-time delivery (`hookflow.RealtimeTrigger`: debounced detached flusher per
session, default on, `OPENBOX_REALTIME=0` opt-out) is implemented and verified at
the binary level (`TestHookRealtimeDelivery` drives the real binary against a mock
core); its testbed phase (`testbed/25-realtime.sh`) exists but has not yet run
against a live local stack.

Known limits, documented in
`docs/architecture.md#assurance--what-the-evidence-proves`: the backend does not sign
policy bundles yet (so `require_verified_bundle` defaults off), Codex's hook cannot be
mandated by `requirements.toml`, Guardrail redaction at source is not wired, and the
production-runtime lineage hop is not joined.

Next: the Cursor adapter; upstream the `shell`/`mcp`/`tool` hook types to
`openbox-sdk-python` to retire the Go mirror; policy template packs.

The epic-by-epic history is in git, not in the tree: read commit messages and the
ADRs for *why*, and the code for *what is true now*.
